title: "Some thoughts"

I am going to my third year and here are some thoughts that I would like to share with you today.

Back when I was in first year, I had no clue what a computer science program would look like since in my mind computer science is just computer programming and programming involves just the the 4 primitive types, namely string, float, int and boolean. For me, at that time, building an application like Discord was beyond my imaginations.

But things changed as soon as I start to learn about OOP. It was the first time that I have come to the realization that everything can be done in a programming language. (Well, this is not so true when I got exposed to the idea of a Turing Machine and Computability theory) That was probably the motivation that pushes me to success in my first year. 

In that summer, instead of taking summer courses, I decided to go back to Vancouver to visit my family. I got 4 months so I decided to also go back to where I used to work back in high school, a local McDonald's store. That summer taught me to never go back to a workforce that pays you minimum wage lol :)
